# Introduction: 
- core java is used to develop standalone apps. such apps are of 2 types: gui based and cli based. 
- adv java is used if we want to build applications which work with the internet. for example any client-server application (non standalone app)
- 3 types of java release: 
	- java standard edition :  Java SE
	- java enterprise edition: Java EE
	- java micro edition: Java ME
- in advanced java, 3 technologies are important: 
	- jdbc (java database connection) - part of JSE
	- servlet - part of JEE 
	- jsp (java server pages) - part of JEE
- high level (unofficial) there may be 3 types of applications:
	- standalone apps
	- web apps
	- enterprise apps
- !! jsp should never contain a single line of java logic code. it is very bad practice to include logic code in jsp. 
- jsp is responsibe only for displaying something to the enduser
- processing and business logic is done in servlet. 
- the connection betn db and servlet is done by jdbc. 
## need of web servers
- to run web application, a special software called as web server is required. eg: tomcat server used commonly to run web applicatoins. 
- webserver tomcat components:
	- web container: responsible to manage and execute servlets and jsp 
		- servlet engine/container: responsible to manage and execute servlets. servlet engine is also known as CATALINA 
		- jsp engine/container: responsible to manage and execute jsp. jsp engine is also known as JASPER.
# JDBC
- steps to implement jdbc:
	- 1: load and register driver
	- 2: extablish connection betn java application and database
	- 3: create statement object
	- 4: send and execute sql query
	- 5: process results from resultset
	- 6: close connection
