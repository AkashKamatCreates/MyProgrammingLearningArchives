- collection (aka container) is an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit. 
- collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate and communicate aggregate data. 
- collections framework: unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. 
- CF contains the following:
	- interfaces: abstract data types that represent collections. 
	- implementations: Concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. (aka reusable data structures)
	- algorithms: computations like searching and sorting on objects are done by these algorithms/methods. the algorithms are polymorphic, meaning same name different functionalities. 
- Pros of java CF
	- reduces programming effort
	- increases program speed and quality
	- allows interoperability among unrelated APIs
	- Reduces effort to learn and to use new APIs
	- Reduces effort to design new APIs
	- fosters software reuse
